                <h2>Welcome to the Mapping the Cost of Mobile Money for SMEs in Kenya Project!</h2>
                <p>
                    In recent years, mobile money has revolutionized the financial landscape in Kenya, providing unprecedented access to financial services for individuals and businesses alike. 
                    However, for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), the costs associated with using mobile money can significantly impact their operations and profitability. 
                    This project aims to explore and map these costs across different regions in Kenya, providing valuable insights for SMEs, policymakers, and financial service providers.

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    Kenya is a global leader in mobile money services, with platforms like M-Pesa revolutionizing financial transactions. 
                    While mobile money has enhanced financial inclusion, the varying costs of these services can significantly impact SMEs, which are vital to Kenya's economy.
                    This project aims to map these costs across different regions, providing insights to help SMEs manage their finances better and to inform policy for fairer practices.

                <h2>Research Methodologies</h2>
                <p>So far, we have currently used two methods of research.</p>
                <ul class="methods">
                    <li>Survey - We conducted a survey among business owners of SMEs we could reach. We have had a sample of 54 responses for now.
                    </li>
                    <li>Articles and thesis - We read these materials that were already published by various trusted organisations.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section id="Findings">
                <h2>Findings</h2>
                <h3>Key Insights</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of competition among Mobile Operators<br>
                        From the survey, we concluded that their is minimal competition among the operators available in Kenya.
                        Mpesa, A subsidiary of Safaricom dominates this field. This encourages them to hike transaction-costs.

                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>Impact on pricing of goods<br>
                        High transaction costs forces a good portion business owners to hike the prices of their goods and services.
                        SMEs that cannot pass on these costs to their clients due to competitive pressure may experience reduced profit margins, impacting their ability to grow and sustain operations.

                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>Frequent Usage Patterns<br>
                        There is a high frequency of transactions using mobile services in SMES' daily business operations. This leads to accumulation
                        of fees that affects their profitability.

                        Despite these according to an article by Kabui Mwangi,a business and tech reporter, on December 19 2023, suggests that 
                        e-payments usage frequency may reduce due to the high taxes levied by the government. More information can be found in

                <h2>CostMap</h2>
                <p>Informed by our comprehensive research on the cost of mobile money for SMEs in Kenya, we are excited to introduce CostMap.
